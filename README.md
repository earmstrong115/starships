# Starships

Setup instructions:

1. Install node

1. Install angular
   * npm install -g @angular/cli@19
   * This uses Angular 19 because the VS template still works off 19 instead of 20

1. In package manager console in VS run this to create the local DB:
   * Update-Database

1. Setup StarWarsApi.Server as the startup project
 
1. Build and run the app from VS, ignore the Swagger page that loads. Open https://localhost:49410/ to see the actual angular app
